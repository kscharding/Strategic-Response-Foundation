<!-- 

The properties in the Manifest are applied when the application is uploaded through the Azure Services Developer Portal. 
They are not applied when debugging or running the application from Visual Studio. 
The following fields cannot be changed once the application is created:
      MultiInstance
      InstallReturnLink
      UnInstallReturnLink
      CallbackHomeLink
      RequireDelegation

If these fields are modified after the initial upload of the application, subsequent uploads will be rejected.

To successfully change these fields a new application must be created through the Developer Portal and 
the new Application Self-Link must be copied into the application’s project properties in Visual Studio.
