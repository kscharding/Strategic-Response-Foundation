To build and deploy future research tools we need to seriously collaborate in a linked and distributed environment. Building on earlier developer events such as Executable Paper Challenge, Life Sciences Challenge and Apps for Science, Elsevier and the 11th International Semantic Web Conference are co-hosting CodeForScience Boston, a competition for building a tool that best extends how scientific researchers search, process, integrate and share. The application concept formulation and submission will take place online, followed by a live coding day on Saturday, November 10th at MIT Stata Center in Cambridge, MA. Prizes will be awarded. Registration for CodeForScience Boston will open in early October.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC3'>2012-11-11T09:00:00+05:00,2012-11-11T17:30:00+05:00,swc:WorkshopEvent,Cambridge,8th International Workshop on Uncertainty Reasoning for the Semantic Web,workshop:ursw/2012,Workshop Chair,Fernando Bobillo,,&quot;Uncertainty reasoning, Uncertainty representation, Imperfect knowledge, Probabilistic ontologies, Fuzzy ontologies&quot;,http://iswc2012.semanticweb.org/workshops/URSW2012,&quot;This workshop will discuss different approach to deal with uncertainty (in a wide sense) in the Semantic Web.

We will then look at the specific tasks involved in mining sentences to extract resource description framework (RDF) triples and show the importance that each level of language analysis can play in such tasks. NLP researchers have been working on such tasks for many years and have developed many algorithms to perform part-of-speech tagging, parsing, semantic disambiguation, named entity recognition and relation extraction. We will present baseline algorithms for these tasks to show expected results from state-of-the-art research. As many algorithms use machine learning (ML) techniques, we will provide a simple introduction to the aims and general principles behind such techniques and explain why they are so important to the NLP community. We will also explore problems that arise when extracting knowledge from multiple sentences and how that is closely related to concept mapping problems, which are familiar to the semantic web community. Since fully automatic text mining is quite a difficult task, we will emphasize that semi-automatic approaches can be effective and viable solutions for facilitating the RDFization of textual data.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC26'>2012-11-11T09:00:00+05:00,2012-11-11T17:30:00+05:00,swc:TutorialEvent,Charles,RDF Query Processing in the Cloud,iswc2012:tutorial-1,Tutorial Organizer,Kemafor Anyanwu,,&quot;RDF Query Processing, Cloud Systems, MapReduce, Query Optimization, RDF Query Processing&quot;,http://research.csc.ncsu.edu/coul/RAPID/RDFQPCloud,&quot;Cloud computing platforms such as AmazonÂs EC2 and Hadoop have had significant adoption as large scale data processing platforms.

Researchers and practitioners from all corners of the field are invited to provide their insights and projections. The event will focus on discussions and the exchange of ideas, and will use a mix of different styles of interaction between the participants. It is always good to try to look ahead and anticipate the development of a field. For the Semantic Web, it is now particularly important because recent developments indicate that Semantic Web technologies are entering the industrial mainstream. Schema.org and the Facebook Open Graph Protocol are bringing metadata to bear on the Web large-scale. IBMÂs Watson and AppleÂs Siri incorporate Semantic Technologies. Google is revamping its search approach and is going more semantic in implementing their knowledge graph. And these are just a few of the prominent examples. The commercial uptake will be a game-changer for the field. It seems that only a fraction of the research results of the past ten years are currently being picked up. It seems that shallow semantics brings added value in many, but not all, application areas. In others it seems that there are roadblocks for which deep semantics is required for added value Â but current approaches are still limited. Linked Data and Big Data are popular buzzwords right now, but could they be hitting a peak on the expectation curve? If so, what is going to happen in the subsequent dive? If not, how will those areas affect the fieldÂs future?

A key part of this workshop is bringing together those from industry and government as well as those from academia. In order to interact successfully in an open and heterogeneous environment, being able to dynamically and adaptively integrate data from other systems Âon the goÂ is necessary. This may not be a precise process but a matter of finding a good enough understanding to allow interaction to proceed successfully. With the advent of the Web, there are massive amounts of information available online that can assist in this task, but this information is often chaotically organised, stored in a wide variety of data-formats, and difficult to interpret. The other part of this workshop (SemQuant) aims to unlock a new paradigm in Semantic Web research, and even in KR research in general, by adding a quantitative research paradigm to the traditionally predominant qualitative logic-based paradigm. This is motivated in part by the significant growth in Semantic Web data, including ontologies and Linked Data, over recent years. To efficiently manage the vast quantities of knowledge and data on the Semantic Web, we need theories and tools to address questions like: How can we measure knowledge? How are these measurements different from measurements of information? How can we efficiently store knowledge? How can we efficiently and accurately transform knowledge on noisy channels like the Web? How can we measure the quality of ontologies and other forms of knowledge?

Because of this avalanche of data, it is increasingly hard to validate, reproduce, reuse and leverage scientific data. In addition, although publications, methods and datasets are very related, they are not easily accessible and interlinked. The notable exception is omics research where journals require deposit of sequences in databanks as a condition of publication. Even where data is discoverable and accessible, significant challenges remain in data reuse and sharing, in facilitating the necessary correlation, integration and synthesis of data across levels of theory, techniques and disciplines. In the 2nd International Workshop on Linked Science (LISC2012) we will discuss and present results of new ways of publishing, sharing and linking scientific data together, and reasoning over such data to discover interesting new links to validate research. The theme of this yearÂs workshop will focus on research addressing these issues with respect to big data. Big Data is loosely characterized by the size and/or number of individual files, the number of represented variables, a range of physical scales, a range of scientific disciplines, heterogeneous metadata and data formats, in short data that cannot easily be accessed and manipulated from a thumb-drive.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC97'>2012-11-12T09:00:00+05:00,2012-11-12T12:30:00+05:00,swc:TutorialEvent,Lexington,The Web of Data for E-Commerce in Brief,iswc2012:tutorial-5,Tutorial Organizer,Alex Stolz,,,http://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Events/ISWC2012,&quot;A Hands-on Introduction to the GoodRelations Ontology, Schema.org, RDFa and Microdata Authoring, Google Rich Snippets for Products, Yahoo, Bing, and Linked Open Commerce.

The approach for writing semantic adapters for new event sources and semantic patterns to be detected in event streams will be introduced.&quot;</div><div class='line' id='LC119'>2012-11-13T08:30:00+05:00,2012-11-13T09:00:00+05:00,swc:SpecialEvent,Imperial,Opening Ceremony,iswc2012:special/opening-ceremony,,,,,,</div><div class='line' id='LC120'>2012-11-13T08:30:00+05:00,2012-11-13T21:00:00+05:00,swc:SpecialEvent,Exeter,Registration,iswc2012:special/registration-2012-11-13,,,,,,</div><div class='line' id='LC121'>2012-11-13T09:00:00+05:00,2012-11-13T10:30:00+05:00,swc:TalkEvent,Imperial,Keynote 1,iswc2012:talk/keynote-1,,,,,,</div><div class='line' id='LC122'>2012-11-13T10:30:00+05:00,2012-11-13T11:00:00+05:00,swc:BreakEvent,Corridor-Foyer railings,Coffee Break,iswc2012:break-2012-11-13-1,,,,,,</div><div class='line' id='LC123'>2012-11-13T11:00:00+05:00,2012-11-13T12:30:00+05:00,swc:SessionEvent,Plaza,Description Logic,iswc2012:session/research-02,ISWC2012 Session Chair,Pascal Hitzler,,,,</div><div class='line' id='LC124'>2012-11-13T11:00:00+05:00,2012-11-13T12:30:00+05:00,swc:SessionEvent,Statler,Infrastructure,iswc2012:session/inuse-01,ISWC2012 Session Chair,Tudor Groza,,,,</div><div class='line' id='LC125'>2012-11-13T11:00:00+05:00,2012-11-13T12:30:00+05:00,swc:SessionEvent,Georgian,Linked Data,iswc2012:session/research-01,ISWC2012 Session Chair,Tom Heath,,,,</div><div class='line' id='LC126'>2012-11-13T11:00:00+05:00,2012-11-13T12:30:00+05:00,swc:SessionEvent,Arlington,&quot;Search, question answering and entity summarization&quot;,iswc2012:session/evaluation-01,ISWC2012 Session Chair,Manfred Hauswirth,,,,</div><div class='line' id='LC127'>2012-11-13T12:30:00+05:00,2012-11-13T14:00:00+05:00,swc:SpecialEvent,Whitier,JWS Lunch,iswc2012:special/jws-lunch,,,,,,</div><div class='line' id='LC128'>2012-11-13T12:30:00+05:00,2012-11-13T14:00:00+05:00,swc:BreakEvent,Imperial,Lunch,iswc2012:lunch-2012-11-13,,,,,,</div><div class='line' id='LC129'>2012-11-13T14:00:00+05:00,2012-11-13T15:30:00+05:00,swc:SessionEvent,Arlington,Evaluation of reasoning with ontologies,iswc2012:session/evaluation-02,ISWC2012 Session Chair,JÃ©rÃ´me Euzenat,,,,</div><div class='line' id='LC130'>2012-11-13T14:00:00+05:00,2012-11-13T15:30:00+05:00,swc:SessionEvent,Georgian,Queries,iswc2012:session/research-04,ISWC2012 Session Chair,Maria-Esther Vidal,,,,</div><div class='line' id='LC131'>2012-11-13T14:00:00+05:00,2012-11-13T15:30:00+05:00,swc:SessionEvent,Plaza,User Interfaces and Personalization,iswc2012:session/research-03,ISWC2012 Session Chair,Natasha F.
